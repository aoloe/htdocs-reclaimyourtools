Reclaim your tools, the device of the Libre Graphics Meeting 2010
(LGM), is a concept created by Open Source Publishing. We are related
with the LGM and we are using this wonderful slogan promote the libre graphics software
for professional graphic artists.

We hate to to say it, but this site is still in the "under construction". Our
plans are:

- Create a multilingual information site from the libre graphics community for the graphic arts industry.
- The content will mainly consist of:
  - a project browser, where you can find a description and a four-pages brochure (pdf) for each of our projects
  - press releases (both in text and pdf)
  - press kits (pdf)
  - professional use cases
- A blog or ticker with news targetted to our audience
